Useful unadorned utilities for powerful Python programming.



By design, there are no required dependencies for this project. It's designed to be simple to add to your code, either by pip, or just by adding a shinerainsoftesvenutil.zip file next to your code and importing it.

There are some optional dependencies to enable a few unimportant features,

* module `Send2Trash`, to send files to OS trash location
* module `crc64iso`, to get the crc64 of a file
