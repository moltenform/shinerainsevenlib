shinerainsevenlib documentation
===============================

Useful unadorned utilities for powerful Python programming.

A Python2 compatible version of this library can be found here, `shinerainsevenlib_prev <https://github.com/moltenform/scite-with-python/tree/main/src/scite/scite/bin/tools_internal/ben_python_common>`_.

This project is useful for:

* functionality that isn't yet in the standard library

   * example: compressing and uncompressing .7z archives.

* functionality that is in the standard library, but isn't as intuitive

   * example: `files.run` is a convenient way to start a process.

* functionality for quickly writing one-off scripts

   * example: `files.writeAll` defaults to utf-8 and is quick to type and read.
