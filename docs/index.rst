Overview
===============================

Useful unadorned utilities for powerful Python programming.

`python -m pip install shinerainsevenlib`

|

This project is useful for:

* functionality that isn't yet in the standard library

   * example: compressing and uncompressing .7z archives.

* functionality that is in the standard library, but isn't as intuitive

   * example: files.run is a convenient way to start a process.

* functionality for quickly writing one-off scripts

   * example: files.writeAll defaults to utf-8 and is quick to type and read.
